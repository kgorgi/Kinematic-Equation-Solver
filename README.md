## Kinematic Equation Solver
### Synopsis:
The Kinematic Equations Solver is a Windows based command line program built using Notepad++ and the MinGW C Compiler. This program solves kinematic physics problems by using the five fundamental variables: displacement, time, acceleration, initial velocity, and final velocity. It can solve for any of the above variables, all that is required is that the user enter three other variables (thus leaving one variable blank). For example, given displacement, time, and initial velocity the program could compute the acceleration or final velocity.

## Motivation:
The main purpose behind this project to is apply the fundamental programming concepts and skills to the complex nature of kinematics. These concepts and skills include: using functions, headers, external C libraries, control statements, pointers, handling user input, and exception handling due to physics. (example: the time cannot be negative)

## Installation:
To use the Kinematic Equation Solver please download and run the "Kinematic_Equation_Solver.exe" file in the releases tab. Please note your anti-virus may need to be disabled in order for the program to function properly.
